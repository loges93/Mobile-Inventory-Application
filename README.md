# Mobile Inventory Application
 SNHU Final Project

My built mobile inventory software was meant to solve the necessity for effective warehouse item tracking and management. Developing a user-friendly interface that lets users quickly examine, add, remove inventory goods while getting low stock notifications was the primary objective. Important screens comprised item management forms, inventory display grid, and login screen. Ensuring simple navigation and open, easily accessible designs helped me to keep the user in mind. Each screen was broken down into reasonable chunks for the coding process, and I tested often using iterative development to apply changes. Ensuring the app worked as intended and pointing out areas that required improvement depend on testing. Developing the low-stock alert system proved to be one of the main difficulties, however SMS alerts helped to address it. Implementing the inventory management tools were especially fruitful for me since it proved my abilities in design and functioning.
